# Install

Assuming youâ€™ve already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and ([Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or
[GraalVM](http://www.graalvm.org/)), install the project management utilities development tool.

## Using NPM

```bash
yarn global add es4x-pm # OR npm install -g es4x-pm
```

::: tip
Using `npm` should be the preferred way to install as it allows easy upgrades and should be portable across different
*Operating Systems*. 
:::

## OS package

When working on CI environments where the amount of packages is limited, the package manager can be installed by
unzipping the prepackaged tar/zip file.

```bash
ES4X='0.9.0' \
  curl -sL \
  https://github.com/reactiverse/es4x/releases/download/$ES4X/es4x-pm-$ES4X-bin.tar.gz \
  | tar zx --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local
```

For Windows Operating Systems the same can be done using a `zip` file instead.


## Verify the installation

You should now have a `es4x` command available in your path, you can test it by running:

```
$ es4x --help

Usage: java -jar /usr/local/bin/es4x-bin.jar [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
            [arg...]

Commands:
    bare         Creates a bare instance of vert.x.
    dockerfile   Creates a generic Dockerfile for building and deploying the
                 current project.
    init         Initializes the 'package.json' to work with ES4X.
    install      Installs required jars from maven to 'node_modules'.
    list         List vert.x applications
    run          Runs a JS script called <main-verticle> in its own instance of
                 vert.x.
    start        Start a vert.x application in background
    stop         Stop a vert.x application
    version      Displays the version.

Run 'java -jar /usr/local/bin/es4x-bin.jar COMMAND --help' for
more information on a command.
```

::: warning
For best experience and performance please install [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org). When working on standard JDK,
using Java < 11 will run on `Interpreted` mode which is not performance or recommended for production.
